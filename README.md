This is the final commit in Peer Assessment project.  `pml.html` is the required file to be submitted, but it is difficult to view it from Github.  You could download all the files as ZIP file and view the compiled HTML file after unzipping the file.  It you have difficulty viewing or downloading, the PDF file is also in the repository as `pml.pdf`.
